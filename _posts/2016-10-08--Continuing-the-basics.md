    <td>This lesson I learnt that you have to work efficiently and carefully with my partner and I got a lot of work done and was close to finishing my target. My target was to finish all of the second one in the lesson and and get on to the third.. We got through to part 7 of the second coding area but then time ran out so I couldn't do my target in the end.</td>

    <td>Just like last week my partner and I couldnâ€™t figure out what some bits meant so that took up a bit of our time. I need to use my brain more on what things mean and get a lot more work done next week then this week.</td>

    <td>Next week I will try my best to get a lot more work done and not continue arguing. And next week I will continue to take turns with the work. My target for next lesson is to finish the second area and get onto the third.</td>

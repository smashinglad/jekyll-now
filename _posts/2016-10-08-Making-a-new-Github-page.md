    <td>I learnt how to get rid of one website then making one for its place. The strategy I used was look at the website first then go back to Github and make the changes that had to be made. My target was to make a new Github website by the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my work was that I had to keep asking my friends questions for what to do. I need to work on working independently and ask fewer questions to my friends. Now I know how to make one there will be fewer questions already. </td>

    <td>I will make sure that I do my work quicker so I could get on to using the FUZE BOX but I also need to work carefully and try and stop myself from making silly mistakes and not rush my work making me miss things out. </td>

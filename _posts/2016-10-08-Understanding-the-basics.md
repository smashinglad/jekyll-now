    <td>I learned that it not really hard to do the coding if I read the book carefully and got a good result in the end by reaching my target. My target was to finish one of the areas in the book then start the second one. The strategy that me and my partner used was one of us read the book and the other would do what they said on the Fuze box. We took turns and didn't end up fighting about it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It took me a while to understand what to do at times so I wasted quite a lot of time trying to figure out what it meant and what I had to do. The habits I need to work on is to work harder and get more work done instead of fussing about what they mean.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will try and not waste as much time on trying to figure out what it meant and do more work. And my target for next lesson will be to finish the one weâ€™ve started and then get
 onto the next one.   </td>

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

This lesson my partner and I were starting the third area and then starting the fourth. I learnt that we had to improvise and then we had to update our blogs as well. We had to make a border for our writing. 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need work on?

The things that limited my learning was the work I had to do to my blog. There were quite a few things I needed to do to my blog before I could get on to using the FUZE box. 

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

Next time I need to work faster so I can get on to the FUZE box especially when the work is extremely easy to do. I need to improve on working with my partner as we do fight a bit on what to do.

My target was to get onto the robot arm in the lesson. We did the first part but then time ran out so I couldn't do my target in the end. </td>

    <td>My partner and I always kept fighting over what to do so we didnâ€™t do as much as we should have done. The habits I need to work on is to work harder and get more work done instead of fussing about what to do..

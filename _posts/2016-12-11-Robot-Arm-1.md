    <td>I learnt that it is very easy to get a lot of work done if my partner and I work well as a team. The strategy my partner and I used was to keep switching places. My target this week was to get the robot arm moving which took a while to figure out. My partner and I finished my target slowly but did it in the end.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to write things because it was different to the others we did but figured out what to do. I need to use my brain more and work out things more quickly, so then I could do more of the robot arm and get quite far.</td>

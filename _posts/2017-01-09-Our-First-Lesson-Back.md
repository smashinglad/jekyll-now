Our First Lesson Back 

Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

I had to learn a few things this lesson. One of those was to learn from mistakes by me and also by others. We learnt this when the teacher showed us a blog made by one of our peers and showed mistakes in the blog. This was good for us as we learnt good and bad things in blogs and what not to do. Now I know how to write better blogs so I won't make mistakes so it would be better for me and my learning. 

 What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Something that limited my learning was I sometimes lose focus of what the teacher says and get confused. When I get confused I start to panic a bit until I find out what to do. I need to work on focusing more on what the teacher says and not focusing on other things that can distract me.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I will remember to look through my work for mistakes starting with this one. I also need to work on focusing on the teacher so I can get more work done and not be behind and not wondering what I have to do.

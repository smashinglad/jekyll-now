    <td>In this week's lesson we learned how to use a new coding website called Codecadamy. I learned how to do this by reading and doing exactly what the instructions told me to do. This was a very good way for me to get more of the work done.     </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that I hadn't used Codecadamy before. So that was something that limited the amount of work I did. I need to work on using Codecadamy a bit more so then I can get more work done.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will do my best to get more work done by doing the coding faster and more efficiently. Also I will concentrate better on the work I’m doing so I don’t get left behind.</td>

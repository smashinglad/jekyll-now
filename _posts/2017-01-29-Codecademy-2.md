    <td>In this lesson I learnt how to do more things with the coding programme Python. I learnt a lot more in this lesson than last lesson as I think I did more this time. I used the same strategies I used last week as they worked really well this time as well. They were to read the instructions very carefully and do exactly as they told me to do. We also learned that copying other people's work doesn’t help you learn. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson the thing that limited my learning was that I had to work harder as the coding was more complicated than the work I did last lesson. I need to work on my strategy so I can do more work next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work more independently and focus more on the instructions. I will sometimes ask for help but that will be after I do everything I can think of doing to work it out and they won’t give me the answer but only clues to get me closer to it.</td>

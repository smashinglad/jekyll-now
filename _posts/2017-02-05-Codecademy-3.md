    <td>This weeks lesson was about not giving up and continuing however hard things get. I learnt to not give up when doing this by looking for every possibility to get the answer but I didn't reach my target which was to get up to 20% but I narrowly missed it by 1%. This was a good strategy as I could do more work on Codecademy. And still used my first strategy which was reading everything on the instructions.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Because things get harder and harder, the more work we do, it slowed me down as I was a bit slower this week but did still did more work than I did last week because the strategy I used was effective. I need to work on my strategies so I can get more work down.</td>

    <td>Next time I donâ€™t think I will change anything because I learnt a lot more and worked more efficiently. I will continue to use my two strategies and work my way to 25% which is my target for next lesson.</td>

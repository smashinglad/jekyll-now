    <td>This lesson I learnt from last week's lesson about not giving up and I didn't give up at this lesson that I was having trouble with. I didn’t give up until I tried everything I could think of and then eventually ask my teacher for help. I learnt that the instructions don’t sometimes clearly state what you have to do and that you have to think quite a bit to understand. I used my same strategies as last week and got far but missed my target but 2%. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that one section that I had trouble with. I spent quite a lot of my time trying to do it and ended up using about 10 to 15 mins. I need to work on working faster and ask questions when I desperately need them.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure I work faster and if I get stuck I will ask for help after I used my previous knowledge. I will continue to use my strategies and I will try and get to 27% next lesson.</td>

    <td>This lesson I did work on PygLatin which was extremely hard. I did end up doing a lot of work but for some reason the percentage of my work didn't change. I used my strategies effectively and got a lot of work done but didn’t change. I learnt that a lot of work could be just a small part of the whole thing as I realised that I had only done 23% out of 100% after a lot of work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning as the PygLatin section as I have finished the first part quickly but then on the final coding in the second part I spent a lot of time working it out so I couldn’t do as much as I could. I need to work on working faster and ask for help sometimes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure I work faster and if I get stuck I will ask for help after I used my previous knowledge. I will continue to use my strategies and I will try and get to 27% next lesson.</td>

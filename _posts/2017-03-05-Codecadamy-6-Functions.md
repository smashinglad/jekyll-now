    <td>This lesson I did a lot of work to get my target done. I got 28% and I was pleased with that. I have also finished PygLatin. I learned to focus more on the work then on others things. Also we all gathered around the front and talked about how our blogs had to be. We had to change colours for the table which was pretty easy. I used my same strategies.</td>

    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning was when I got to Functions I slowed down again because it is a new topic. I need to work on maintaining the pace of my work so I can get my target done.</td>

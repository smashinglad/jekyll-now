  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I had a bit of trouble with a few exercises but I learnt how to do it by asking for help and then I got the answer by working it out with clues they gave. I used my same strategies as usual and also got further in Python..</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning was that I got distracted at times and looked at what my partner was doing which was what I did for a while. I need to work on staying focused on what I was doing and not what my partner was doing.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I stay focused on my work and stay on track. I will continue to use my strategies and I should work faster. My target for next lesson will be 35%. </td>

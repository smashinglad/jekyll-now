    <td>This lesson I did the work quickly to get more exercises done but I did this by concentrating on my work and not the work my friends were doing. I stayed focus on the task ahead and got a lot of work and got to 38%. I used my same strategies as usual and also got further in Python..</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning was that I got a little tired of doing the Python coding so I decided to look at other things on Codecademy so need to work on staying focused a bit more so I can do more work.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that I stay focused on my work and not wonder what else I can do. I will continue to use my strategies and I should work faster. My target for next lesson will be 42%. </td>

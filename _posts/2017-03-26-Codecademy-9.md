Also we had to make a diary of what coding we did at home.

WEDNESDAY

I did extra work at home and I was on This is key. It was a bit tough but I did get it in the next five minutes as I had done it already in other coding exercises. Then I did another one which was called Control Flow and Looping. This took me a lot longer as I had to put much more effort into working it out. It took me about 15 minutes to complete but I got to the end.

FRIDAY 

On Friday I only did the next exercise because I didn't have much time to do a lot. It was called Lists + Functions. This was very challenging as it took longer to do and it was hard for me to do because the coding had a lot in it for me to do but I finished it in 20 minutes.

I didn't do any more as I had not time.

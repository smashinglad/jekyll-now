  <tr>
    <td>We learn that it was as easy as doing a word into code as we just had to do the same thing but switch the code with the alphabet so that the code = the alphabet.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning was the fact that I didn't realise how easy it was to do that I was trying lots of different things but it was all the same as the code before. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try think more reasonably so that I can get the way to do easier and quicker.</td>

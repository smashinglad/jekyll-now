First lesson back of 2018

**What we did?**

This lesson we had a new teacher for the new term and we did a new coding. We started on Repl.it. That lesson, we learnt about a code that asked you questions and you had answer back and it asks you the next question. We had to ask for their name, how are you, how old you are and other questions.

**What limited my learning**

I sometimes lost my focus on my learning and got distracted and when I got confused I panicked a bit. So I need to improve on my focus.

**What will I change next time?**

Next time I will try my best to focus on my work and not get distracted by my surroundings that way I can get more of my work done.

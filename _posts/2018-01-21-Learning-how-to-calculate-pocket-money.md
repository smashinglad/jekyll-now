Learning how to calculate pocket money 

**What we did?**

This lesson we learnt more coding and made a code that calculate how much pocket money a person gets over a couple of weeks. We had a set amount of money a person gets and then multiplied with how many weeks the money was given to him.

**What limited my learning?**

The thing that limited my learning was I like last lesson lost my focus and didn't concentrate on my own work.

**What will I change next time?**

Next time I will try to focus more than I did last lesson and concentrate a lot more aswell.

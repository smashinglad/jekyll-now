**Finishing my Buzzfeed Quiz**

**What we did?**

This lesson we continued working on my buzzfeed quiz. My quiz was nearly finished and all I needed to do was make the answers add up to give a percentage. I managed to work it out with help from my teachers as I had an error in my coding.

**What limited my learning?**

I think if I focused more on my coding I wouldn't have made an error.

**What will I change next time?**

I will hopefully be able to make my coding easier as the teacher showed me a method that I could use that would use a lot let coding.
